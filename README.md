# Mental Rotation Experiment using _magpie

This repository contains a basic mental rotation task using materials from Ganis & Kievit (2015). The implementation was part of the university course "Experimental Psychology Lab" taught by Prof. Dr. Michael Franke at the University of Osnabrueck in the summer term 2021.

## Experiment

The experiment uses a 2 (rotation: 50 degrees, 150 degrees) x 2 (match: same, different) within subjects design.

Participants view 48 pairs of images of 3D shapes and respond (forced binary choice) whether the images depict the same shape or different shapes (when rotated).


## \_magpie

This experiment was built using [\_magpie](https://magpie-ea.github.io/magpie-site/index.html).
